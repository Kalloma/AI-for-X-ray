# AI-for-X-ray
Building AI course project
## Summary
When you have an accident and injure an extremity, you will most likely do an X-ray. When the picture is taken, it is a doctor who writes the diagnosis. But what if one could make the diagnosis for this type of occur through AI. The X-ray image is made up of pixels and it should theoretically be possible to carry out a calculation through an algorithm that shows the probability of broken bones.

## Background
X-rays have undergone a major change over the last few decades and AI is an element that will affect development even further. The images today are digital, unlike when they were analog. But the images are still visualized using the same S-curve to mimic a tradional X-ray. What occurs then is that the digtial informatio is filtered away and not taken advantage of. What if you could use AI help to detect or even diagnose, for example, broken bones?

## How is it used?
X-ray image is taken
The algorithm is be placed over the image as a filter.
The algorithm is then detect an area where a suspicion of bone fractures exists.
When the area is identified, users must click past a number of multiple choice questions e.g
Do you see the broken leg?
What type of fracture can you detect?
etc. Once the questions are answered and a preliminary diagnosis can be made.
Data sources and AI methods
Logistic model could maybe be the AI model due each pixel in the x-ray image cwould be assigned a probability between 0 and 1, with a sum of one.

## Challenges
To have the algortithm CE markt or/and FDA approved due to the will determine a medical diagnosis.

## What next?
To evaluate the market and learn from what is probably already developed and look at its challenges and opportunities in a continued mapping towards being able to create an AI product for the diagnosis of bone fractures in an X-ray image.
